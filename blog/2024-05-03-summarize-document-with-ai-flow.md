Whether you're looking to summarize key information or ask specific questions about a document's content, AI-FLOW offers an intuitive solution. This guide provides a straightforward setup to help you efficiently integrate document processing into your workflow.

### Understanding the Workflow

Many users attempt to use the file upload noteâ€™s output as the direct input for a GPT node. However, this method is not feasible because the file upload node serves a different purpose.

### The Role of the File Upload Node

The file upload node is primarily designed for uploading files and generating a URL to access the file. This URL can then be used to interface with various APIs, but it does not directly handle file content extraction.

### Extracting Text from Your Document

To extract text from your document, you should utilize the Document-to-Text node.

### Using the Template

For ease of use, this basic setup has been included in the Template menu of AI-FLOW. You can now access and implement this template with just a few clicks, streamlining your document processing tasks.
