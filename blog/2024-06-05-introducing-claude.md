- temperature : Use a temperature closer to 0.0 for analytical/multiple-choice tasks and closer to 1.0 for creative and generative tasks.
- max_tokens : The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

Here are the 3 models descriptions according to [Anthropic documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) :

- Claude 3 Opus: Most powerful model, delivering state-of-the-art performance on highly complex tasks and demonstrating fluency and human-like understanding
