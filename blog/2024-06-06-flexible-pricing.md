**This article only concerns the hosted version of the application.**

Inspired by valuable user feedback, our new **Flexible Pricing** strategy is now live, offering a more streamlined and cost-effective approach to using the platform. This update allows users to specify their API keys when logged in, providing greater flexibility and control over their usage and expenses.

## Understanding the Hybrid System

Hereâ€™s how the new system works:

- **Credits by Default:** Upon logging into the app, you can access everything by default if you have platform credits.
- **Add Your API Keys:** You can add your API keys and use the related nodes for free, with a minor fee for resource usage.
- **Avoid Duplicated Services:** This system prevents users from paying for services they already have, ensuring they only pay for the platform's resources.

While the hosted version remains practical for some, this system ensures the platform's long-term viability and provides a fair approach for all users.

## Transition to the New System

Our goal is to make this flexible pricing system the standard. Starting June 24, it will replace the current "Use my own keys" option, simplifying the process for all users. We encourage you to explore this new feature and share your feedback with us.

## Conclusion

The introduction of flexible pricing options marks a significant step forward in enhancing user experience on our platform. By integrating your API keys and benefiting from a resource-based fee structure, you can enjoy a more personalized and cost-effective service.

We are eager to hear your thoughts on this new strategy. Please feel free to share your feedback as we continue to improve and evolve our platform to better meet your needs.
