**Introducing Enhanced StabilityAI Integration in AI-FLOW**

With the integration of StabilityAI's API into AI-FLOW, we've broadened our suite of features far beyond Stable Diffusion 3. This integration allows us to offer a versatile range of image processing capabilities, from background removal to creative upscaling, alongside search-and-replace functionalities.

Given the expansive set of tools and the ongoing advancements from StabilityAI, we've adopted a more flexible integration approach, akin to our implementation with the Replicate API. Our goal is to support automation and rapid adoption of new features released by StabilityAI.

Here's a rundown of the features now accessible through AI-FLOW, as per the StabilityAI documentation:

- **Control - Sketch**: Guide image generation with sketches or line art.
- **Control - Structure**: Precisely guide generation using an input image.
- **Edit - Outpaint**: Expand an image in any direction by inserting additional content.
- **Edit - Remove Background**: Focus on the foreground by removing the background.
- **Edit - Search and Replace**: Automatically locate and replace objects in an image using simple text prompts.
- **Generate - Core**: Create high-quality images quickly with advanced workflows.
- **Generate - SD3**: Use the most robust version of Stable Diffusion 3 for your image generation needs.
- **Image to Video**: Employ the state-of-the-art Stable Video Diffusion model to generate short videos.
- **Upscale - Creative**: Elevate any low-resolution image to a 4K masterpiece with guided prompts.

These enhanced capabilities are great assets for your image processing workflow. Explore these features and find innovative ways to enhance your projects! [Try it now!](https://app.ai-flow.net)
