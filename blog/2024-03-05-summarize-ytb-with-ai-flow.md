Discover two effective ways to summarize YouTube videos using AI-FLOW. Whether you're creating content summaries or extracting specific information, AI-FLOW simplifies the process with its advanced AI nodes.

### Using the YouTube Transcript Node

Leverage the YouTube Transcript Node to automatically retrieve video transcriptions via the YouTube API. This transcription can then serve as input for the GPT-4 node to generate concise summaries or detailed analyses.

### Using Whisper

For a more robust solution, utilize the `turian/insanely-fast-whisper-with-video` model on Replicate. Simply input the YouTube URL, and the model will process the video's audio to produce a high-quality transcription. This transcription is ready for further processing with AI-FLOWâ€™s GPT-4 node or other analysis tools.
