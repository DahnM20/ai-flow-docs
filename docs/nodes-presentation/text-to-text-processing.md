# Add text-to-text processing

In modern applications, leveraging AI for text-to-text processing has become invaluable. Whether it's to use the power of models like GPT for generating content or to utilize generic AI actions for various tasks, integrating such nodes can transform the way you handle data. Here's how to use two primary text-to-text processing nodes in our application.

:::tip Note

You need to add your **OpenAI API Key** in the configuration menu to use the following nodes.

:::

## GPT Prompt

With the GPT Prompt node, you can harness the capabilities of GPT to generate content based on a given prompt. Simply provide the desired prompt, and let the node produce the desired output.

If you add an input node to the GPT Node, then the output of the previous node will be the initial context of the GPT Node.

For example :
