In AI-Flow, the node concept plays a pivotal role in defining and orchestrating data flows. These nodes enable users to structure and tailor operations, whether it's to process text, extract data from a URL, retrieve YouTube subtitles, query GPT, or even generate images.

## Basic actions

### Node Structure

Each node has "handles," which are connection points for data. 

- <Highlight color="#72c8fa">Blue Handle</Highlight>: Represents the <b>input</b> of the node. Through this handle data is injected into the node for processing.
- <Highlight color="rgb(224, 166, 79)">Orange Handle</Highlight>: Signifies the <b>output</b> of the node. Once data is processed within the node, it's emitted from this handle.

### Placement 

To add a node to your flow:

1. **Select** the desired node from the left sidebar.
2. **Drag & Drop** the node into the workspace to place it at your desired location.

### Interaction

Once your nodes are in place, you can establish links (edges) between them:

1. **Grab** a handle (input or output) from a node.
2. **Draw** a line towards the corresponding handle (input or output) of another node to establish a connection.

By connecting nodes, you define the path the data will take, allowing it to flow and be processed by consecutive nodes.

### Move handles

You can change the position of a handle by hovering over it, then selecting the new position in the box that appears at the top.

### Delete a specific node or edge

You can delete a node/an edge by clicking on it, then pressing the Backspace key.

Mastering the node concept and their interconnection offers you powerful flexibility in constructing and customizing complex data flows. Feel free to experiment, combine, and connect different node types to execute sophisticated operations and meet your specific needs.


## Run the flow

### Run all nodes

You can run all the nodes by clicking on the "RUN ALL" button. 


![Run All](/img/page-images/how-to-use-nodes/run-all.png)

:::danger Note
By doing this, all previous output will be overwritten by the most recent ones.
:::

### Run a specific node

Each node has a small "Play" icon at the top right. You can run a specific node by clicking this icon.

This will only overwrite the output of that node.

:::tip Note

If your node is connected to a node that has not been launched, the application will run the previous node before running the one you selected.

## Other tools


The right sidebar on the application can be expanded. It provide few functionnalities to manage you with your flow. 

There you can see your flow as a raw JSON file. 

This file can be downloaded, if you want to save your flow and later on uploaded.

:::tip Note

By default your flow is saved locally on your browser. As long as you don't clear the cache, you'll get access to your flow.
Saving your flow as a JSON file helps ensure your flow is backed up securely.

### Clear all output

To clear all output, you can expand the right sidebar and click on "Delete Output".

### Delete all 

The delete all button will remove all the nodes on your current flow.
