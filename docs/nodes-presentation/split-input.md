# Split input with AI

## Data Splitter

This tool, leveraging the advanced capabilities of GPT-4, specializes in dissecting and organizing inputs into distinct segments. 

It is particularly adept at handling inputs that inherently possess logically separated concepts. For instance:

Idea 1 : .....

Idea 2 : .....

Idea 3 : .....

Alternatively, it can process inputs formatted in a series like:

Idea 1, Idea 2, Idea 3


Upon receiving such structured data, this node effectively divides the input into 'N' distinct outputs, each corresponding to a unique idea or concept.

Please note, the efficacy of segmentation may vary. Inputs that are overly complex or excessively lengthy could lead to less-than-perfect splitting, as the system may struggle with logically partitioning such data.
