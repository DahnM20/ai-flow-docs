# Installation Using Windows Executable (.exe)

### Prerequisites

- A Windows-based system.

Download the latest version of AI-Flow for Windows from the official releases page: [AI-FLOW Releases](https://ai-flow.net/release/).

After downloading, simply run the provided `.exe` file. This executable launches a local server, enabling direct access to AI-Flow's user interface as a standalone Windows application.

### Important Configuration

- **Replicate Node API Key**: To utilize the Replicate Node, ensure you set the `REPLICATE_API_KEY`.
  You can configure this via the application settings in your App Configuration.

- **File Upload Feature**: Some nodes require the file upload feature enabled to function correctly or to facilitate communication with other nodes. For detailed guidance on enabling and configuring file uploads, please refer to the corresponding [documentation article](/docs/file-upload/file-upload-s3.md).
